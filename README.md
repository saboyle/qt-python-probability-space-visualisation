# qt-python-probability-space-visualisation

Exploration of graphical representations of static and dynamic probability spaces using Qt.

A number of versions will be developed:

## Version 1 - static visualization (heatmap)

    Representation of arbitrary percentages on a 2d heatmap using pre-defined colour maps.

##  Version 2 - dynamic visualization (heatmap) 

    A colour map linked to timed update, updating the visualization in near real time showing 
    shifting probabilities.
    
##  Version 3 - async visualization (heatmap) 

    As version 2 but connected to message queue async feed.
